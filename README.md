# DS1GameSpeedSlider
This mod for Dungeon Siege 1 adds a slider below the field commands to change the game speed beyond the limits of the retail game.

The slider gets hidden along with the field commands. The game speed is natively saved and restored in saved games.

I made it for LOA but it seems to work on the base game as well and should not conflict with other mods (unless they modify field commands).

It's available on [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/dungeonsiege1/mods/261).

Limitations:

- The new slider doesn't get updated when interacting with the speed slider in the game options or the speed hotkeys, both of which are still capped at a speed of 1.2. I won't fix it because it's most likely source locked.
- You can't change the game speed in multiplayer.
