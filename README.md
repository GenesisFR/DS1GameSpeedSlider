# Genesis' game speed slider
## Description
This mod for Dungeon Siege 1 adds a slider below the field commands to change the game speed beyond the limits of the release version of the game.

The slider gets hidden along with the field commands. The game speed is natively saved and restored in saved games.

It is compatible with DS and LOA and should not conflict with other mods (unless they modify the field commands too).

It's available to download on [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/dungeonsiege1/mods/261).

## Requirements

[Ikkyo's DSDLL](http://ds.gemsite.org/data/ikkyo_dsdll.zip)

## Installation

- Place it in your Resources folder.
- Make sure you have ikkyo.dll or ikkyo_loa.dll in your installation directory.

## Limitations

- The new slider doesn't get updated when interacting with the speed slider in the game options or the speed hotkeys, both of which are still capped at a speed of 1.2. I won't fix it because it's most likely source locked.
- You can't change the game speed in multiplayer.

## Known issues

- On the GOG version, the button on the slider does not get updated upon retrieving the world speed after loading a game. It's visual a bug only and does not affect the actual value of the slider or the functionality of the mod.à
